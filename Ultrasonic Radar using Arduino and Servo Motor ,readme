# Ultrasonic Radar using Arduino and Servo Motor 

A basic radar-like system that scans the surrounding area using an
ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor and displays distance-based
object detection.

##  Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo Motor
- Breadboard & jumper wires

##  Working Principle
The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor across a fixed angle range.
At each angle, the ultrasonic sensor measures distance to nearby objects,
creating a simple radar-style scanning effect.

##  Concepts Demonstrated
- Ultrasonic distance measurement
- Servo motor control using PWM
- Microcontroller interfacing
- Embedded system basics

##  Status
- Circuit implemented and tested
- Basic scanning functionality achieved
